# Etherpad BigBlueButton skin
This project isolated the BigBlueButton skin which is contained in the [bigbluebutton/etherpad-lite](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/etherpad-lite) fork.

The official BigBlueButton setup still uses the quite outdated etherpad fork, but the docker method ([alangecker/bigbluebutton-docker](https://github.com/alangecker/bigbluebutton-docker)) rather relies on...
- the official up-to-date etherpad branch
- this skin for the same nice homogeneous appearance
- a [plugin](https://github.com/alangecker/bbb-etherpad-plugin) for necessary functional patches
